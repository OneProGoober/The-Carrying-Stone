# The-Carrying-Stone
Current progress on The Carrying Stone. I do not have a 3D modeler, so the ingame models are currently simple geometric shape/placeholders.
WARNING: there may be a few bugs in the most recent push to GitHub. The game is in ONGOING DEVELOPMENT.
This is because The Carrying Stone is an ongoing project (and I often push copies of current progress even if they are not currently working so that I do not lose any data)!


Halting progress on this project in favor for another 2D project I've been hoping to develop. I Am planning to completely scrap all project development and start over from scratch (piggy backing on what I've already written). My scripts felt messy and are not suitable for progress on the game in the future. A large deciding point was with my click to move system - I need to convert to tile based system and refactor almost half of my code base. It would be quicker to re-write my code to be much cleaner and simpler!
