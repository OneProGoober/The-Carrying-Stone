# The-Carrying-Stone
Current progress on The Carrying Stone. I do not have a 3D modeler so the ingame models are currently simple geometric shape/placeholders. A few bugs exist as this is an ongoing project and I often push copies of current progress even if they are not currently working (so I don't lose data)! At the time of the first push, the right click dropdown is not properly working and there is an occasional "hard to reproduce" bug with the obstructions that impedes player movement.
