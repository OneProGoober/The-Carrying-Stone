# The-Carrying-Stone
Current progress on The Carrying Stone. I do not have a 3D modeler, so the ingame models are currently simple geometric shape/placeholders.
WARNING: there may be a few bugs in the most recent push to GitHub. The game is in ONGOING DEVELOPMENT.
This is because The Carrying Stone is an ongoing project (and I often push copies of current progress even if they are not currently working so that I do not lose any data)!
